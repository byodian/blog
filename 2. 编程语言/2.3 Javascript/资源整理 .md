## Organization of code in React application

In most applications we followed the principle, by which components were placed in the **directory components**, reducers were placed in the **directory reducers**, and the code responsible for communicating with the server was placed in the **directory services**. This way of organizing fits a smaller application just fine, but as the amount of components increase, better solutions are needed. There is no one correct way to organize a project. The article [The 100% correct way to structure a React app (or why there’s no such thing)](https://medium.com/hackernoon/the-100-correct-way-to-structure-a-react-app-or-why-theres-no-such-thing-3ede534ef1ed) provides some perspective on the issue.

## Frontend and backend in the same repository

- frontend and backend into separate repositories.

    copy the bundled frontend codes into the backend repository.

- desploy the frontend code separately.

    Especially with applicatioins created using create-react-app it is very straightforward thans to the included [buildpack](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).

- there may be a situation where the entire application is to be put into a single repository.

    a commom approach

    - put the *package.json* and *webpack.config.js* in the root directory
    - place the frontend and backend code into their own directories, e.g. *client and server.*

## Changes on the server

How do we reflect the results of the computation to the frontend?

1. One way is to execute [polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science)) on the frontend, meaning repeated requests to the backend API e.g. using the [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)-command.
2. A more sophisticated way is to use [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API), using which it is possible to establish a two-way communication channel between the browser and the server. In this case the browser does not need to poll the backend, and instead only has to define callback functions for situations when the server sends data about updating state using a WebSocket.

    WebSockets are an API provided by the browser, which is not yet fully supported on all browsers: [https://caniuse.com/?search=websocket](https://caniuse.com/?search=websocket)

3. Instead of directly using websockets api it is advisable to use the **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)-library**, which provides various fallback-options in case the browser does not have the full support for WebSockets.
4. **GraphQL** provides a nice mechanism for notifying clients when there are changes in the backend data.

## Virtual DOM

When a software developer uses React that they rarely or never directly manipulate the DOM.

The function defining the React component returns a set of [React-elements](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#elements).

The React-elements make up the [Virtual DOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#what-is-the-virtual-dom). 

With the help of the [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) the virtual DOM defined by the components is redered to the a real DOM that can be shown by the browser using the DOM API.

## [On the role of React in applications](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part7/class_components_miscellaneous#on-the-role-of-react-in-applications)

[Model View Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) - pattern then the domain of React would be *view.*

In small applications data handled by the the application is being stored in the state of React-components, so in this scenario the state of this components can be thought of as a model for an MVC-architecture.

Using [redux-thunk](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part6/communicating_with_server_in_a_redux_application#asynchronous-actions-and-redux-thunk), the business logic can be almost completely separated from the React code.

the [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)-api offers one alternative solution for centralized state management without the need for third party libraries such as redux.

## Current trends

- static type check - Typescript
- Server side rendering
- isomorphic applications and universal code

    Writing universal code directly using React is currently still pretty cumbersome. Lately a library called **Next.js**, which is implemented on top of React, has garnered much attention and is a good option for making universal applications.

- Progressive web apps

    The offline functionality is usually implemented with the help of [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API).

- Microservice architecture vs. monolithic backend

- Serverless

## Useful libraries and interesting links

One good place to find libraries is [https://applibslist.xyz/](https://applibslist.xyz/)

lodash - handle complicated data

ramda - functional programming style

date-fn - handling times and dates

Formik and redux-form - handle forms easier

recharts and highcharts - displays graphs

[https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js](https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js)

redux-saga provides an alternative way to make asynchronous actions for redux thunk familiar from part 6. Some embrace the hype and like it.

For single page applications the gathering of analytics data on the interaction between the users and the page is [more challenging](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications) than for traditional web-applications where the entire page is loaded. The [React Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/single-page-applications) -library offers a solution.
