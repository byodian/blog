## HTML & CSS
HTML is not structure, at least not as it pertains to how the user perceives it.
HTML provides semantic structure, which really means it deals with the meaning of the relationship between objects.
**Ideally there is a loose relationship** between the **semantic structure and the visual structure** of things. There are a ton of multiplying advantages to that being true, but it is not necessary.

So if HTML does not provide a sense of visual structure, what does?
It turns out that CSS is really pulling double duty here, and that is the secret, the missing piece of the puzzle.

While HTML is used to define the structure and semantics of your content, **CSS is used to style it** and **lay it out**.
If CSS is handling two concerns, creating separate components for style and layout is the next logical step.
**Components style themselves, and position their immediate children.**

## What is style and what is position?

when it comes to CSS, just think of the box model. Anything that affects only the border-box inward, is style.

Everything else is position.

## What does this look like in practice?

The easiest way to write CSS that demonstrates this principle is by using the immediate child selector.

```sass
.component {
  & > .compoment-part {
    margin: auto;
  }
}
```

## Visual design
Visual design in web development is a broad topic.

- Typography
- color theory
- graphics
- animation
- page layout

## Responsive web design
Today, there are many types of devices that can be access the web. They range from large desktop computers to small mobile phones. These devices have different screen sizes, resolutions, and processing power.

Responsive Web Design is an approach to design web content that responds to the constraints of different devices.

The page structure and CSS rules should be flexible to accommodate these differences.

## User Interface
A website's user interface has two components. First, there are the visual elements, such as colors, fonts, and images. Second, there is the placement or positioning of those elements.

In responsive web design, a UI layout must accommodate many different devices and browsers accessing the content.

## Applied Accessibility
"Accessibility" generally means having web content and a user interface that can be understood, navigated, and interacted with by a broad audience. This includes people with visual, auditory, mobility, or cognitive disabilities.

Here are three general concepts this section will explorer throughout the following challenges:

- Have well-organized code that use appropriate makeup
- Ensure text alternative exist for non-text or visual content
- Create a easily-navigated page that's keyboard-friendly
- Give links meaning by using descriptive link text


### Add a Text Alternative to Images for Visually Impaired Accessibility
### Know when alt text should be left blank
- sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them.
- images are used for decoration only.

**Note:** For images with a caption, you may still want to include `alt` text since it helps search engines catalog the image's content. But it can be set to an empty string.

```html
<img src="...jpeg" alt=""> 
```

### Improve readability with high contrast text
The **contrast radio** for normal text is calculated by comparing the relative luminance values of two colors.
Recommended at least **4.5:1**
This range from **1:1 for the same color**, or no contrast, to **21:1 for white against black**, the strongest contrast.

In practice, the 4.5:1 contrast radio can be reached by shading (adding black to) the darker color and tinting (adding white to) the lighter color.

- Darker shades on the color wheel are considered to be shades of blues, violets, magentas, and reds, whereas lighter tinted colors are oranges, yellow, greens, and blue-greens.

### Avoid colorblindness issue by using sufficient contrast
First, color alone should not be used as the only way to convey important information because screen readers users won't see it.

Second, foreground and background 

### Make Links Navigable with HTML Access Keys
`accesskey` 
The global attribute provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut for current element. The attribute value must consist of a single printable character.

### Use tabindex to add keyboard focus to an element
`tabindex` 

Use tabindex to specify the order of keyboard focus for several elements

Avoid using the tabindex attribute in conjunction with non-interactive content to make something intended to be interactive focusable by keyboard input. An example of this would be using a <div> element to describe a button, instead of the <button> element.

## HTML document
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- `<html></html>`  root element
- `<head></head>` This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that this isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers.
- `<meta charset="utf-8">` utf-8 includes most characters from the vast majority of written language.

## Make a element only visible to a  screen reader by using custom css
This happens when information is in a visual format (like a chart), but screen reader users need an alternative presentation (like a table) to access the data. CSS is used to position the screen reader-only elements off the visual area of the browser window.

```css
.sr-only {
	position: absolute;
	left: -100000px;
	top: auto;
	width: 1px;
	height: 1px;
	overflow: hidden;
}
```
